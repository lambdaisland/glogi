# 1.0.70 (2020-08-19 / df34f1a)

## Changed

  client consumers will already have specific versions declared for their project.

# 1.0.63 (2020-05-05 / bcafca0)

## Added

- the Closure constant `lambdaisland.glogi.console.colorize` can now take four

  = `:config`)

# 0.0-36 (2020-03-30 / e2606fb)

## Added

  `severe`, `fine`, `finer`, `finest`

- Use the correct console log method (log, error, warn, info) based on the log
  level

# 0.0-33 (2020-03-25 / cd9df6b)

## Added

- Added the ability to use keywords or symbols to look up a logger, or the
  special `:glogi/root` to find the root logger.

## Fixed

- Fixed `set-levels` to match its docstring. Takes a map.

# 0.0-29 (2020-03-25 / 991866f)

# 0.0-18 (2019-06-11 / a27f7fc)

## Added

- `lambdaisland.glogi.console` provides an alternative to `goog.debug.Console`,
  with the main benefit that it will log full data structures, thus playing
  nicely with cljs-devtools
- Added an `info` macro for compat with pedestal.

## Changed

- The default formatter is now `identity` instead of `pr-str`. This way we
  preserve full data structures until the last minute. Note that goog.debug.Logger
  will stringify the message, unless care is taken for it not to.

# 0.0-13 (2019-06-10 / 0668ebe)
